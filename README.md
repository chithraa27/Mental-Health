# Mental-Health
Mental health has become a prominent issue in recent years, as it impacts not just individuals, but also companies and society as a whole.

## Problem
Roughly 20% of adults are coping with mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or ADHD. In the tech industry, characterized by a high-stress work environment, long hours, constant availability expectations, and a blending of professional and personal life due to open-source commitments, it's crucial to ensure that individuals most vulnerable to mental health challenges receive support and aren't left behind. This can be achieved through proactive mental health initiatives, destigmatizing mental health conversations, promoting work-life balance, and offering resources and assistance to tech professionals facing these challenges.

## Objective
This notebook aims to illuminate the state of mental health in the industry from 2014 to 2019 and provide solutions for a healthier and more sustainable future. The data presented here is sourced from surveys conducted by Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) between 2014 and 2019. These surveys were designed to evaluate people's perceptions of mental health and the prevalence of mental health disorders within the technology industry.
